    "avatarTechnology": {
      "title": "The Impact of Avatars on the Human Brain",
      "intro": "The impact of avatar teachers on the human brain represents an emerging and fascinating research field that combines cognitive neuroscience and educational technologies.",
      "neuralNetworks": "When we interact with an avatar teacher, our brain activates the same neural networks that operate during real social interactions. The superior temporal cortex and regions involved in theory of mind become active, allowing us to attribute pedagogical intentions to the avatar.",
      "engagement": "70% of learners affirm that interaction with AI technologies makes their courses more engaging. The avatar teacher can adapt to each learner's cognitive pace, thus optimizing neuroplasticity.",
      "stressReduction": "Unlike a human teacher, the avatar does not generate social stress, allowing the prefrontal cortex to focus entirely on cognitive learning processes rather than anxiety management. This stress reduction promotes an optimal mental state for acquiring new knowledge.",
      "rewardSystem": "Avatar teachers can trigger dopamine release in the brain's reward circuit through immediate and positive feedback. This stimulation of the ventral striatum reinforces intrinsic motivation and facilitates information encoding in long-term memory.",
      "multimodalIntegration": "An avatar teacher combines visual, auditory, and sometimes gestural stimuli, simultaneously activating multiple cortical areas. This multimodal integration at the superior parietal cortex level enriches memory traces and improves information retention.",
      "adaptiveTeaching": "The avatar can adapt its pedagogical strategies in real-time according to the learner's neurological reactions, thus optimizing teaching effectiveness. This technology potentially revolutionizes education by creating adaptive learning environments that respect the constraints and opportunities of our brain architecture."
